# Daily Life Gamified App

This project is an Expo application built with TypeScript. To run the project locally you will need Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install
npm run android   # or npm run ios or npm run web
```

Expo will start the Metro bundler and provide instructions for running the app on your target device. Ensure the Expo CLI is installed globally if the `expo` command is not found.
