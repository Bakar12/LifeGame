# Daily Life Gamified App

This project is an Expo application built with TypeScript. To run the project locally you will need Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install
npm run android   # or npm run ios or npm run web
```

The scripts use `npx` so you don't need a global Expo CLI installation. When run for the first time Expo CLI will be downloaded automatically.
